# Medical Ethics:

* Includes:
  * A non-technical presentation comparing the levels of complexity of three models of addiction, and their effectiveness in capturing the macroscopic dynamics of addiction.
    * The presentation was prepared for my Medical Ethics (UGPH-GU 52/PHIL-UA 50) during my third semester.
  * The NetLogo code associated with one of the models, and its predecessor, presented in the presentation.
